## What is a Logic Map?

A Logic Map is a structured representation of your policy's rules. Instead of treating your policy as unstructured text, Synkro extracts discrete rules with:

- **Rule ID** - Unique identifier (R001, R002, etc.)
- **Text** - The rule statement
- **Category** - Type of rule (threshold, requirement, permission, etc.)
- **Condition** - When the rule applies
- **Action** - What should happen
- **Dependencies** - Other rules this depends on

## Example

Given this policy:

```
All expenses over $50 require manager approval.
Receipts required for expenses over $25.
Travel expenses require pre-approval.
```

Synkro extracts:

```
R001: Expenses over $50 require manager approval
  - Category: threshold
  - Condition: expense > $50
  - Action: require manager approval

R002: Receipts required for expenses over $25
  - Category: requirement
  - Condition: expense > $25
  - Action: require receipt

R003: Travel expenses require pre-approval
  - Category: requirement
  - Condition: expense type = travel
  - Action: require pre-approval
```

## Accessing the Logic Map

```python
result = pipeline.generate(policy, traces=50, return_logic_map=True)

# Inspect rules
for rule in result.logic_map.rules:
    print(f"{rule.rule_id}: {rule.text}")
    print(f"  Category: {rule.category}")
    print(f"  Dependencies: {rule.dependencies}")

# Get the dataset
dataset = result.dataset
```

## Interactive Editing

With `enable_hitl=True`, you can review and edit the Logic Map before generation:

```
╭────────────────── Logic Map (3 rules) ──────────────────╮
│ ├── R001: Expenses over $50 require manager approval    │
│ ├── R002: Receipts required for expenses over $25       │
│ └── R003: Travel expenses require pre-approval          │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Enter feedback: add a rule for client meals limited to $75
✓ Added R004: Client meals limited to $75 per person

Enter feedback: done
```

## Commands

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `remove R002` | Delete a rule |
| `add a rule for...` | Add new rule |
| `show R001` | View rule details |
| `done` | Continue with current Logic Map |
| `undo` | Revert last change |
| `reset` | Restore original |
