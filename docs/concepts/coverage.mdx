title: Coverage Tracking
description: "Ensure your dataset covers all policy aspects"

## What is Coverage?

Coverage tracking measures how well your generated scenarios cover different aspects of your policy—like code coverage but for training data.

## Coverage Report

```python
result = synkro.generate(policy, traces=50, return_logic_map=True)
print(result.coverage_report)
```

Output:
```
Coverage Report
========================================
Overall: 68%
Sub-categories: 2 covered, 1 partial, 1 uncovered

Gaps:
  - Receipt requirements [HIGH] (0% coverage)
  - Travel booking rules [MEDIUM] (40% coverage)

Suggestions:
  1. Add 3+ scenarios for 'Receipt requirements'
  2. Add edge_case scenarios for 'Travel booking'
```

## Coverage Statuses

| Status | Coverage | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Covered** | 80%+ | Well-tested |
| **Partial** | 30-80% | Needs more scenarios |
| **Uncovered** | &lt;30% | Gap in coverage |

## Improving Coverage

### Interactive Mode

Use natural language commands in HITL mode:

```
Enter feedback: improve coverage for receipt requirements
✓ Added 5 scenarios for 'Receipt requirements'
Coverage: 0% → 72%

Enter feedback: get travel booking to 80%
✓ Added 3 scenarios for 'Travel booking'
Coverage: 40% → 85%
```

### Programmatic

```python
# Access coverage data
report = result.coverage_report

# Check gaps
for gap in report.gaps:
    print(f"Gap: {gap.sub_category} ({gap.coverage_percent}%)")

# Export as dict/JSON
data = report.to_dict()
json_str = report.to_json()
```

## Coverage Metrics

Each sub-category tracks:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `coverage_percent` | % of expected coverage achieved |
| `scenario_count` | Number of scenarios testing this |
| `type_distribution` | Breakdown by positive/negative/edge |
