title: Quickstart
description: "Generate your first dataset in 5 minutes"
---

## Installation

```bash
pip install synkro
```

## Set Your API Key

Synkro uses LLMs to generate data. Set your API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
# or
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
```

## Generate a Dataset

### Using Built-in Examples

```python
from synkro import create_pipeline
from synkro.examples import EXPENSE_POLICY

pipeline = create_pipeline()
dataset = pipeline.generate(EXPENSE_POLICY, traces=50)
dataset.save("training.jsonl")
```

### From Your Own Policy

```python
from synkro import create_pipeline

policy = """
All expenses over $50 require manager approval.
Receipts required for expenses over $25.
Client meals limited to $75 per person.
"""

pipeline = create_pipeline()
dataset = pipeline.generate(policy, traces=50)
dataset.save("training.jsonl")
```

### From Files

```python
from synkro import create_pipeline
from synkro.core.policy import Policy

policy = Policy.from_file("handbook.pdf")  # PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD
pipeline = create_pipeline()
dataset = pipeline.generate(policy, traces=100)
```

## Output

Your dataset is saved in JSONL format:

```json
{"messages": [
  {"role": "user", "content": "Can I expense a $200 team dinner?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "For a $200 team dinner, you'll need manager approval since it exceeds the $50 threshold..."}
]}
```
