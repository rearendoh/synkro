## Overview

The **INSTRUCTION** dataset type generates single-turn question-answer pairs.

Best for: Instruction-following models, RAG systems, or when you don't need multi-turn context.

## Usage

```python
from synkro import create_pipeline, DatasetType

pipeline = create_pipeline(dataset_type=DatasetType.INSTRUCTION)
dataset = pipeline.generate(policy, traces=100)
dataset.save("training.jsonl")
```

## Output Format

```json
{"messages": [
  {"role": "user", "content": "What's the approval process for a $350 expense?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "For a $350 expense, you'll need manager approval since it exceeds the $50 threshold. Here's the process:\n\n1. Submit your expense report in the system\n2. Attach the original receipt\n3. Your manager will receive a notification\n4. Approval typically takes 1-2 business days\n\nOnce approved, reimbursement is processed within 14 business days."}
]}
```
