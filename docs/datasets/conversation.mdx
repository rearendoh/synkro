## Overview

The **CONVERSATION** dataset type generates multi-turn dialogues where the user and assistant have back-and-forth exchanges.

Best for: Fine-tuning chat models that need to handle follow-up questions and context.

## Usage

```python
from synkro import create_pipeline, DatasetType

pipeline = create_pipeline(dataset_type=DatasetType.CONVERSATION)
dataset = pipeline.generate(policy, traces=50)
dataset.save("training.jsonl")
```

## Output Format

```json
{"messages": [
  {"role": "user", "content": "What's the approval process for a $350 expense?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "For a $350 expense, you'll need manager approval since it exceeds the $50 threshold. Please submit your expense report with the receipt attached."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "What if my manager is on vacation?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "If your manager is unavailable, you can request approval from their designated backup or escalate to your skip-level manager. The approval requirement still applies regardless of availability."}
]}
```

## Conversation Turns

Control the number of turns per conversation:

```python
# Fixed turns
dataset = pipeline.generate(policy, traces=50, turns=3)

# Auto (based on policy complexity)
dataset = pipeline.generate(policy, traces=50, turns="auto")
```

| Complexity | Auto Turns |
|------------|------------|
| Simple | 1-2 |
| Conditional | 3 |
| Complex | 5+ |

## Interactive Adjustment

In HITL mode, adjust turns with natural language:

```
Enter feedback: shorter conversations
✓ Set to 2 turns

Enter feedback: I want 5 turns
✓ Set to 5 turns

Enter feedback: more thorough
✓ Set to 6 turns
```

## Export Formats

```python
# Standard messages format (default)
dataset.save("data.jsonl", format="messages")

# ChatML format
dataset.save("data.jsonl", format="chatml")
```
