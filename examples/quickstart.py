"""
Synkro Quickstart - RLAIF Data Generation
==========================================

Generate high-quality chat fine-tuning datasets:
- LLM generates diverse scenarios from your policy
- Strong model creates expert responses
- AI grader filters by quality against policy rules
- Output: Ready-to-train JSONL with only passing traces

Dataset types: CONVERSATION (multi-turn), INSTRUCTION (single-turn), TOOL_CALL (with function calling)

See other examples for advanced features.
