Example: Coverage Tracking for Scenario Diversity

Coverage tracking measures how well your generated scenarios cover
different aspects of your policy - like code coverage, but for policies.

This helps you:
- Identify gaps in scenario coverage
- Ensure all policy areas have test cases
- Improve coverage with natural language commands
